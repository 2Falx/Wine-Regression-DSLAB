#####Abstractâ€”

In this report we introduce a possible approach to the Wine-Review Regression problem.
In particular, we try to build up a regression model capable to deduce wines quality based on some given attributes.
The proposed approach consists in the extraction of some numerical features from the given categorical ones and use this new dataset as an input for some regression models.
